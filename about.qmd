Hello there! 

I'm Borja, an engineering physicist with a taste for computation. I'm currently doing my PhD at [ICFO](https://www.icfo.eu/) - The Institute of Photonic Sciences, where I develop machine learning algorithms to tackle problems in quantum and statistical physics.

In my projects, I lean towards the computational side. I love coding and I take great pleasure when things work optimally. Although it is even better when they are also understandable! Therefore, I like to provide my projects and publications with structured code libraries to reproduce my results and, hopefully, provide the reader with a better understanding about the matter.    

Besides computation, I also like the geeky side of computers. I've spent more time than I would like to admit gaming and learning how to build my own computers. I also enjoy life outdoors, though! I love climbing and skiing :D

## Education

| 2024 expected - **PhD in Machine learning for physics**
|    *ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences*
| 2018 - **MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems**
|    *UPF - Pompeu Fabra University*
| 2017 - **BSc in Engineering Physics**
|    *UPC BarcelonaTech - Polytechnic University of Catalonia*

## Experience
I'm on a bit of a wild ride going from industry to academia and combining pure machine learning and science.

| 2019 - Present -- **PhD Student**
|    *ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences*
| 2019 -- **Research stay**
|    *QMUL - Queen Mary University of London* & *Tooso Inc*
|    Industrial collaboration that lead to [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73622-y) and the
|    posterior acquisition of Tooso by Coveo.
| 2018 -- **Research Intern**
|    *Telefonica R&D*
|    I developed the infrastructure to start a research line in
|    brain-computer interface.
| 2016-2017 -- **Research fellow** (two [INIREC](https://app.becas-santander.com/en/program/becas-santander-upc-inirec) grants)
|    *UPC BarcelonaTech* & *Banco Santander*
|    I studied the electromagnetic properties of sensitive plants
|    to develop brain imaging techniques.

## Teaching

I really enjoy teaching and I try to do it as much as I can. 


* Since 2020, I've been teaching the Machine Learning subjects in the [MSc in Quantum Science and Technology](https://quantummasterbarcelona.eu/) and the [MSc in Photonics](https://photonics.masters.upc.edu/en).

* In 2021 I taught part of the *Statistics and data analysis* course in the [MSc of Multidisciplinary Research in Experimental Sciences](https://mmres.bist.eu/), which inspired [this blogpost series](https://brequena.com/posts/2021-10%20Statistics/anova.html). In the previous year I taught the python programming sessions.

* In August 2021 I taught the programming sessions in the [summer school of machine learning for quantum physics and chemistry](https://szkoly.idub.uw.edu.pl/) in Warsaw.

* From 2019 to 2021 I taught physics to first year engineering students at UPC BarcelonaTech.
